# Analog-Design-Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of analog, mixed-signal, RF, and power electronics practice circuits. It serves both as a personal learning journey and as a reference guide for others interested in circuit design. Each project includes schematics, simulations, and short reports with design insights, results, and lessons learned.
