# Analog-Design-Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of analog, mixed-signal, RF, and power electronics practice circuits. It serves both as a personal learning journey and as a reference guide for others interested in circuit design. Each project includes schematics, simulations, and short reports with design insights, results, and lessons learned.

Analog Design Portfolio
ðŸ“– About

This repository is a collection of practice circuits and systems in the analog domain, covering analog IC design, mixed-signal, power electronics, RF, and sensor interfaces.
It serves as both:

A personal learning log, documenting my progress and experiments.

An educational resource for others who want to explore analog and mixed-signal design through examples and simulations.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Build a progressive library of circuits, from intermediate building blocks to advanced systems.

Explore different domains of analog electronics:

Analog IC design

Mixed-signal (ADC/DAC, comparators)

Power electronics (LDOs, converters)

RF & microwave (LNAs, mixers, oscillators)

Document key insights, trade-offs, and lessons learned.
